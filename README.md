# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

- The purpose of this project was to create a basic workday Scheduler. 
- This project allowed be to practice using functions and for loops as well as using moment to get current dates and times.
- I used a default bootstrap ul then modified it for my usage.
- I added an insert box into the li and changed the icons to submit buttons. 

## Usage

- To use the workday scheduler you can click on the box and input the tasks you have to do.
- Make sure you press save after inputing your schedule in order to save into to your local storage. 
- The scheduler changes colors as the day progresses. If the block is green you are in the current hour. If the block is grey the time has not happened yet. If it is red the time has already passed. 
- My portfoilio can be viewed at the following link: https://iluton.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/
